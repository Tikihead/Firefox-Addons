the zip files are just for reference,
download the XPI file and then click the "tools"
tab in firefox, choose "Add-ons", then click the 
"Extensions" icon on the far left, and look for the
"settings" ICON ( a small gear wheel ) maybe top right?
Click that and choose "Install Add-on from File"...
and navigate to where you downloaded the XPPI file :)
